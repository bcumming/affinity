affinity
========

Simple applications for determining Linux thread and gpu affinity.

There are examples for OpenMP and MPI+OpenMP.
* `affinity.omp` : for testing thread affinity without MPI
* `affinity.mpi` : for testing thread affinity of each rank in an MPI job
* `affinity.rocm` : for testing AMD GPU affinity of each rank an MPI job
* `affinity.cuda` : for testing NVIDIA GPU affinity of each rank in an MPI job
